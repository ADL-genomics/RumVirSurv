# RumVirSurv
Data and tools related to the surveillance of viral pathogens in domestic ruminants using metagenomic sequencing approaches.

This repository will include the data that the Penn State Animal Diagnostic Lab uses for surveillance of viruses in domestic ruminant species. We have recently developed a targeted sequence capture system for sequencing viruses of clinical importance in ruminants (specifically, cattle, goats and sheep). In this repository, we share a list of the designed sequence probes that can be synthesized. This list will be updated as needed. 

Here is a simplified representation of the hybrid-capture target sequencing that we are using.

# Coming soon

* A detailed methodology for the design of target probes.
* A detailed protocol for sample processing and sequencing using this method.
* Data and Bioinformatics tools used for data analysis/
